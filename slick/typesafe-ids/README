Pre-requisites
--------------

MySQL is installed. (You can use another database but the instructions and code assume MySQL)
SBT is installed.



Running the code
----------------

In the project root directory execute the following from the command line.

mysql -u root < setup/database.sql
mysql -u demo_user -D typesafe_ids -p  < setup/schema.sql   (when prompted, enter 'letmein' as the password)
sbt slick-gen   (this is optional because the Slick schema metadata has already been generated and committed as SchemaMetadata.scala)
sbt test



Outcome
-------

You should see a single test pass and the database will still be populated with the test data.
