Pre-requisites
--------------

SBT is installed.


Running the code
----------------

In the project root directory execute the following from the command line.

sbt gen-build-desc   (this is optional because a pre-built build descriptor has been committed as build-info.txt)
sbt test - you should see an application test pass (irrelevant) and a build metadata test pass.
sbt run - the build descriptor should be available from http://localhost:9000/assets/build-info.txt
